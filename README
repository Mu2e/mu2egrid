How to make a ups product from this package
The process requires cmake and cetbuildtools v2_03_06 as ups products.

1. check out the code 
   We will refer to this directory as source_code_dir
2. create a working build directory somewhere
   We refer to the build directory as build_dir
3. cd build_dir
4. source source_code_dir/ups/setup_for_development
5. cmake $CETPKG_SOURCE
6. make package
   This creates a tarball in build_dir 
   The tarball is your ups product, 
   ready to be copied and unwound in artexternals
